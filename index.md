I am a web developer helping to make the world a better place through 
JavaScript, Ruby, and UI design.

I am an open-source contributor and I like making things that help people
with their work. I am the author of projects such as [Transit], [Js2coffee], 
     [Nprogress], [Mina], [Ubuntu Dust], and [more][Github].

I manage the [Manila.js] community, hosted [JSConf Asia 2013], and regularly 
speak in conferences.
