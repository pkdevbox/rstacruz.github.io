Manila.js, the Philippine JavaScript developers meetup group, is always looking 
for venues to hold our events. Here's some basic information on our meetups.

### Schedule

Our next meetup is on `November 7th, Friday`. The event is typically scheduled 
on the first Friday of the month.

### Attendees

Our typical head count is between 50 to 90 people. These are usually developer 
and designer professionals coming in after their work. We cap registrations 
depending on the capacity of the venue to prevent going over-capacity.

### Time slot
Our programme takes 2 hours. The usual time slot is 7pm to 9pm.

### Programme
There will be 3 talks, each taking 20 minutes. There will be two 20 minute 
breaks in between for socializing and snacks.

### Seating
Seats for the attendees are highly preferred, but they often don't mind standing 
up if needed.

### Tech requirements
Video projector and microphone equipment are preferred, but not required.

### Registration booth
We'll have volunteers man the registration booths in the front desk. This is to 
count their attendance and provide the attendees with name tags.

### Food
Manila.js is an effort by the community, for the community. Our food is 
typically sponsored by some generous attendees and local startups. As food 
sponsors, they get rights to being promoted in Manila.js announcements.

### After-drinkup
Some attendees would like to socialize after the event, so we often designate a 
nearby bar so they can hang out afterwards. This is often a KKB affair, though 
some generous patrons offer to sponsor drinks for people as well.

### Website
Our website is [manilajs.com](http://manilajs.com)â€”feel free to take a look 
around.
